s="Python is the language of choice for many advanced data tasks for a very good reason.Python is one of the easiest advanced programming languages to learn. Intuitive structuresand semantics mean that for people who are not computer scientists, but maybe biologists,statisticians, or the directors of a start-up, Python is a straightforward way to perform a wide variety of data tasks. It is not just a scripting language, but a full-featured objectoriented programming language."
